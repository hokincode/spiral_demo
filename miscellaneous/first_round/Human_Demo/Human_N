Hi, my dear friend N,

I am trying to do a psychology inquiry survey. It would really great if you kindly help me by answering the following question? Thank you so much for your invaluable support!
Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel.

white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls.

Please tell me your plan to exit the maze.

Just send me back your response would be great!

Best,
Hokin

Hey, sounds cook!
Hmm if the walls in the black on are not too high maybe I will jump on the lower black (in the z-dimension). Otherwise, I will take the boring path of the full white thing.
Hope that helps!

Hi N,

Thank you tremendously for the help!

Your answer is absolutely excellent and demonstrates that you are a person not a machine. Could you also tell me the plan to exit this (slightly different) maze though (as if I am blind-folded)

Best,
Hokin


Here I will go to the left, then jump on the wall towards the green and will go out. If the wall is too high, will take the loop.

Good to know I am not a machine, though. Maybe it will interest you https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13087
