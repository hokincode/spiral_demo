Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
To navigate the maze from the initial position at (3,3) to the exit at (5,6) without using algorithms and by checking each move, we need to carefully plan each step, ensuring we avoid walls and backtrack when necessary. Here's a step-by-step linguistic plan to reach the exit:

1. **Start at (3,3)**.
2. **Move Right to (3,4)**:
   - Check if (3,4) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,4).
3. **Move Right to (3,5)**:
   - Check if (3,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,5).
4. **Move Right to (3,6)**:
   - Check if (3,6) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,6).
5. **Move Down to (4,6)**:
   - Check if (4,6) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,6).
6. **Move Down to (4,5)**:
   - Check if (4,5) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,5).
7. **Move Down to (4,4)**:
   - Check if (4,4) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,4).
8. **Move Down to (4,3)**:
   - Check if (4,3) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
9. **Move Down to (4,2)**:
   - Check if (4,2) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
10. **Move Left to (3,2)**:
    - Check if (3,2) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
11. **Move Up to (2,3)**:
    - Check if (2,3) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
12. **Move Up to (2,4)**:
    - Check if (2,4) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
13. **Move Up to (2,5)**:
    - Check if (2,5) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
14. **Move Up to (2,6)**:
    - Check if (2,6) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
15. **Move Down to (4,1)**:
    - Check if (4,1) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
16. **Move Down to (5,1)**:
    - Check if (5,1) is an open path. It is an open path, move to (5,1).
17. **Move Right to (5,2)**:
    - Check if (5,2) is an open path. It is an open path, move to (5,2).
18. **Move Right to (5,3)**:
    - Check if (5,3) is an open path. It is an open path, move to (5,3).
19. **Move Right to (5,4)**:
    - Check if (5,4) is an open path. It is an open path, move to (5,4).
20. **Move Right to (5,5)**:
    - Check if (5,5) is an open path. It is an open path, move to (5,5).
21. **Move Right to (5,6)**:
    - Check if (5,6) is an open path. It is an open path, move to (5,6).
22. **Exit**:
    - You have reached the exit at (5,6).

This plan involves systematically checking each possible move, ensuring no move leads to a wall without backtracking, and eventually finding the path to the exit.

Human:
(3, 6) is not an open path.

this is wrong
Move Right to (3,6):
Check if (3,6) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,6).

Machine:
Let's revise the steps based on the correct maze layout and find an alternative route.

Starting at position (3,3) and aiming to reach the exit at (5,6), here is the revised step-by-step plan:

1. **Start at (3,3)**.
2. **Move Down to (4,3)**:
   - Check if (4,3) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
3. **Move Left to (3,2)**:
   - Check if (3,2) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,2).
4. **Move Left to (3,1)**:
   - Check if (3,1) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,1).
5. **Move Up to (2,1)**:
   - Check if (2,1) is an open path. It is, so move to (2,1).
6. **Move Up to (1,1)**:
   - Check if (1,1) is an open path. It is, so move to (1,1).
7. **Move Right to (1,2)**:
   - Check if (1,2) is an open path. It is, so move to (1,2).
8. **Move Right to (1,3)**:
   - Check if (1,3) is an open path. It is, so move to (1,3).
9. **Move Right to (1,4)**:
   - Check if (1,4) is an open path. It is, so move to (1,4).
10. **Move Right to (1,5)**:
    - Check if (1,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (1,5).
11. **Move Down to (2,5)**:
    - Check if (2,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (2,5).
12. **Move Down to (3,5)**:
    - Check if (3,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,5).
13. **Move Down to (4,5)**:
    - Check if (4,5) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,5).
14. **Move Right to (3,6)**:
    - Check if (3,6) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,5).
15. **Move Left to (2,6)**:
    - Check if (2,6) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (2,5).
16. **Move Down to (3,4)**:
    - Check if (3,4) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,5).
17. **Move Down to (4,4)**:
    - Check if (4,4) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,5).
18. **Move Down to (5,5)**:
    - Check if (5,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (5,5).
19. **Move Right to (5,6)**:
    - Check if (5,6) is an open path. It is, so move to (5,6).
20. **Exit**:
    - You have reached the exit at (5,6).

This plan navigates the maze while avoiding walls and ensuring each move is checked before proceeding.

Human:
this is wrong :

Move Left to (3,2):
Check if (3,2) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,2).

Machine:
Let's correct the steps again and find the right path from (3,3) to (5,6).

1. **Start at (3,3)**.
2. **Move Down to (4,3)**:
   - Check if (4,3) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
3. **Move Left to (3,2)**:
   - Check if (3,2) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
4. **Move Up to (2,3)**:
   - Check if (2,3) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).
5. **Move Right to (3,4)**:
   - Check if (3,4) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,4).
6. **Move Right to (3,5)**:
   - Check if (3,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,5).
7. **Move Down to (4,5)**:
   - Check if (4,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (4,5).
8. **Move Down to (5,5)**:
   - Check if (5,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (5,5).
9. **Move Right to (5,6)**:
   - Check if (5,6) is an open path. It is, so move to (5,6).
10. **Exit**:
    - You have reached the exit at (5,6).

By following these steps, you should successfully navigate the maze from (3,3) to (5,6).

Human:
this is wrong:

Move Up to (2,3):
Check if (2,3) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,3).

Machine:
Let's correct the steps once more and find the accurate path from (3,3) to (5,6) in the given maze layout.

Here is the maze layout for reference:
```
maze_layout = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

1. **Start at (3,3)**.
2. **Move Right to (3,4)**:
   - Check if (3,4) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,4).
3. **Move Right to (3,5)**:
   - Check if (3,5) is an open path. It is, so move to (3,5).
4. **Move Down to (4,5)**:
   - Check if (4,5) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,5).
5. **Move Down to (5,5)**:
   - Check if (5,5) is an open path. It is an open path, so move to (5,5).
6. **Move Right to (5,6)**:
   - Check if (5,6) is an open path. It is an open path, so move to (5,6).

This sequence ensures that every move is to an open path, avoiding walls, and reaches the exit at (5,6) effectively.

Human:
this is all wrong

Move Down to (4,5):
Check if (4,5) is an open path. It is a wall. Go back to (3,5).
Move Down to (5,5):
Check if (5,5) is an open path. It is an open path, so move to (5,5).
