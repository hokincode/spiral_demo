Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
Certainly! Here's a step-by-step linguistic plan to navigate through the spiral maze from the initial position (3,3) to the exit at (5,6):

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Initial Position**: (3,3)

2. **Step 1**: Move right to (3,4)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (3,4) is an open path (0).

3. **Step 2**: Move right to (3,5)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (3,5) is an open path (0).

4. **Step 3**: Move right to (3,6)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (3,6) is an open path (0).

5. **Step 4**: Move down to (4,6)
    - Reasoning: The cell below (4,6) is a wall (1). Move back to (3,6) and find an alternative path.

6. **Step 5**: Move back to (3,5)
    - Reasoning: Need to find an alternative path since (4,6) is a wall.

7. **Step 6**: Move back to (3,4)
    - Reasoning: Need to find an alternative path.

8. **Step 7**: Move back to (3,3)
    - Reasoning: Need to find an alternative path.

9. **Step 8**: Move down to (4,3)
    - Reasoning: The cell below (4,3) is an open path (0).

10. **Step 9**: Move down to (5,3)
    - Reasoning: The cell below (5,3) is an open path (0).

11. **Step 10**: Move right to (5,4)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (5,4) is an open path (0).

12. **Step 11**: Move right to (5,5)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (5,5) is an open path (0).

13. **Step 12**: Move right to (5,6)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (5,6) is an open path (0) and it is the exit.

### Summary:
- Start at (3,3).
- Move right to (3,4), then (3,5), then (3,6).
- Find the cell below (4,6) is a wall, so backtrack to (3,3).
- Move down to (4,3), then (5,3).
- Move right to (5,4), then (5,5), and finally (5,6) which is the exit.

This plan involves 12 steps, well within the limit of 50 steps. By checking each move for walls and open paths and backtracking when necessary, the exit is reached.

Human:
your step of moving from (3, 3) to (3, 5) is right. But (3, 6) is a wall. please re-plan

Machine:
Thank you for pointing that out. Let's revise the plan to account for (3,6) being a wall.

### Revised Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Initial Position**: (3,3)

2. **Step 1**: Move right to (3,4)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (3,4) is an open path (0).

3. **Step 2**: Move right to (3,5)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (3,5) is an open path (0).

4. **Step 3**: Move down to (4,5)
    - Reasoning: The cell below (4,5) is an open path (0).

5. **Step 4**: Move down to (5,5)
    - Reasoning: The cell below (5,5) is an open path (0).

6. **Step 5**: Move right to (5,6)
    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (5,6) is an open path (0) and it is the exit.

### Summary:
- Start at (3,3).
- Move right to (3,4), then (3,5).
- Move down to (4,5), then (5,5).
- Move right to (5,6) which is the exit.

This revised plan involves 5 steps, ensuring each move checks for walls and open paths to reach the exit effectively.

Human:
again, moving to (3, 4) is right. But there is a wall (4, 5). you probably need to take more than 10 steps. please don't stop generating until you truly verify your plan

Machine:
Thank you for your patience. Let's re-evaluate the maze carefully and verify each move.

### Revised Step-by-Step Plan:

    - Reasoning: The cell to the right (3,5) is an open path (0).

4. **Step 3**: Move down to (4,5)
    - Reasoning: The cell below (4,5) is a wall (1). Move back to (3,5) and find an alternative path.

5. **Step 4**: Move back to (3,4)
    - Reasoning: Need to find an alternative path since (4,5) is a wall.

10. **Step 9**: Move up to (4,2)
    - Reasoning: The cell above (4,2) is an open path (0).

11. **Step 10**: Move up to (3,2)
    - Reasoning: The cell above (3,2) is an open path (0).

12. **Step 11**: Move right to (3,3)
    - Reasoning: This brings us back to the initial position to try another route.

13. **Step 12**: Move down to (4,3)
    - Reasoning: The cell below (4,3) is an open path (0).

14. **Step 13**: Move down to (5,3)
