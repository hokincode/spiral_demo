Hi, my dear friend F

I am trying to do a psychology inquiry survey. It would really great if you kindly help me by answering the following question? Thank you so much for your invaluable support!
Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel.

white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls.

Please tell me your plan to exit the maze.

Just send me back your response would be great!

Best,
Hokin


Hi Mr. Deng,

I would follow the wall on my right hand side until I reach the exit.

Hi F,

Thank you tremendously for your help! The answer is excellent! What about this maze. Could you tell me your plan to exit (as if I am blind-folded)

Thank you tremendously!

Hokin


Same strategy but with my right hand touching the wall and keep going forward.

Hi Hokinâ€” If I'm interpreting your set up correctly, something like this?

Hi M,

Thank you tremendously for the help!

Your answer is absolutely excellent and demonstrates that you are a person not a machine. Could you also tell me the plan to exit this (slightly different) maze though (as if I am blind-folded)

Best,
Hokin

Follow these two rules in order for every step you take
If you can, take a step forward.
If you can't (ie there is a wall in front of you), turn 90 degrees to the right.

Best,
M
