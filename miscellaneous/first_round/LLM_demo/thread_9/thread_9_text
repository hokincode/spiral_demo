Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
Certainly! Here's a detailed linguistic plan to navigate the maze from the initial position (3, 3) to the exit at (5, 6), checking for walls and open paths along the way. I'll outline each step, ensuring to check for walls before moving.

### Linguistic Plan:

1. **Initial Position:** Start at (3, 3).
2. **Move 1:** Check south (4, 3). It's a wall.
3. **Move 2:** Check west (3, 2). It's a wall.
4. **Move 3:** Check east (3, 4). It's an open path. Move to (3, 4).
5. **Move 4:** Check east (3, 5). It's an open path. Move to (3, 5).
6. **Move 5:** Check east (3, 6). It's an open path. Move to (3, 6).
7. **Move 6:** Check south (4, 6). It's a wall.
8. **Move 7:** Check north (2, 6). It's an open path. Move to (2, 6).
9. **Move 8:** Check east (2, 5). It's an open path. Move to (2, 5).
10. **Move 9:** Check east (2, 4). It's a wall. Return to (2, 5).
11. **Move 10:** Check south (3, 5). It's an open path. Move to (3, 5).
12. **Move 11:** Check south (4, 5). It's an open path. Move to (4, 5).
13. **Move 12:** Check east (4, 6). It's a wall. Return to (4, 5).
14. **Move 13:** Check west (4, 4). It's a wall. Return to (4, 5).
15. **Move 14:** Check north (3, 5). It's an open path. Move to (3, 5).
16. **Move 15:** Check west (3, 4). It's an open path. Move to (3, 4).
17. **Move 16:** Check west (3, 3). It's an open path. Move to (3, 3).
18. **Move 17:** Check south (4, 3). It's a wall.
19. **Move 18:** Check west (3, 2). It's a wall.
20. **Move 19:** Check north (2, 3). It's a wall.
21. **Move 20:** Check east (3, 4). It's an open path. Move to (3, 4).
22. **Move 21:** Check east (3, 5). It's an open path. Move to (3, 5).
23. **Move 22:** Check south (4, 5). It's an open path. Move to (4, 5).
24. **Move 23:** Check south (5, 5). It's an open path. Move to (5, 5).
25. **Move 24:** Check east (5, 6). It's an open path. Move to (5, 6). You have reached the exit.

### Reasoning:
- Each step involves checking the adjacent cells in the order of south, west, east, and north.
- If an open path is found, move to that cell.
- If a wall is encountered, try the next direction.
- Retrace steps if needed to find an alternative path.

This approach ensures that each move is verified against the maze layout to avoid running into walls, and the process is repeated until the exit is reached.

Human:
this is wrong:

Move 5: Check east (3, 6). It's an open path. Move to (3, 6).

Machine:
Let's correct and rework the plan with careful consideration to ensure each step correctly checks for walls and open paths.

### Corrected Linguistic Plan:

1. **Initial Position:** Start at (3, 3).
2. **Move 1:** Check south (4, 3). It's a wall.
3. **Move 2:** Check west (3, 2). It's a wall.
4. **Move 3:** Check east (3, 4). It's an open path. Move to (3, 4).
5. **Move 4:** Check south (4, 4). It's a wall.
6. **Move 5:** Check east (3, 5). It's an open path. Move to (3, 5).
7. **Move 6:** Check south (4, 5). It's a wall.
8. **Move 7:** Check east (3, 6). It's an open path. Move to (3, 6).
9. **Move 8:** Check south (4, 6). It's a wall.
10. **Move 9:** Check west (3, 5). Move back to (3, 5).
11. **Move 10:** Check north (2, 5). It's an open path. Move to (2, 5).
12. **Move 11:** Check north (1, 5). It's an open path. Move to (1, 5).
13. **Move 12:** Check west (1, 4). It's an open path. Move to (1, 4).
14. **Move 13:** Check west (1, 3). It's an open path. Move to (1, 3).
15. **Move 14:** Check west (1, 2). It's an open path. Move to (1, 2).
16. **Move 15:** Check west (1, 1). It's an open path. Move to (1, 1).
17. **Move 16:** Check south (2, 1). It's an open path. Move to (2, 1).
18. **Move 17:** Check south (3, 1). It's an open path. Move to (3, 1).
19. **Move 18:** Check south (4, 1). It's an open path. Move to (4, 1).
20. **Move 19:** Check south (5, 1). It's an open path. Move to (5, 1).
21. **Move 20:** Check east (5, 2). It's an open path. Move to (5, 2).
22. **Move 21:** Check east (5, 3). It's an open path. Move to (5, 3).
23. **Move 22:** Check east (5, 4). It's an open path. Move to (5, 4).
24. **Move 23:** Check east (5, 5). It's an open path. Move to (5, 5).
25. **Move 24:** Check east (5, 6). It's an open path. Move to (5, 6). You have reached the exit.

### Reasoning:
- **Starting at (3, 3)**: We try each direction in order, moving only if there is an open path.
- **From (3, 3) to (3, 4)**: The first available move is east.
- **From (3, 4) to (3, 5)**: Moving east again, as the south direction is blocked.
- **From (3, 5) to (3, 6)**: We keep moving east until hitting a wall, then reassess.
- **Backtrack to (3, 5)**: We backtrack as needed to find alternate routes.
- **Navigate around walls**: Continuing in a structured manner to find open paths until reaching the exit at (5, 6).

Each move is verified against the maze layout to avoid running into walls, ensuring a systematic path to the exit.

Human:
This is wrong: Move to (3, 6).

(3, 6) is a wall. All the others are right

Machine:
Let's correct the plan, taking into account that (3, 6) is a wall. We will need to backtrack from (3, 5) and find an alternative path.

### Corrected Linguistic Plan:

1. **Initial Position:** Start at (3, 3).
2. **Move 1:** Check south (4, 3). It's a wall.
3. **Move 2:** Check west (3, 2). It's a wall.
4. **Move 3:** Check east (3, 4). It's an open path. Move to (3, 4).
5. **Move 4:** Check south (4, 4). It's a wall.
6. **Move 5:** Check east (3, 5). It's an open path. Move to (3, 5).
7. **Move 6:** Check south (4, 5). It's a wall.
8. **Move 7:** Check east (3, 6). It's a wall. Stay at (3, 5).
9. **Move 8:** Check north (2, 5). It's an open path. Move to (2, 5).
10. **Move 9:** Check north (1, 5). It's an open path. Move to (1, 5).
11. **Move 10:** Check west (1, 4). It's an open path. Move to (1, 4).
12. **Move 11:** Check west (1, 3). It's an open path. Move to (1, 3).
13. **Move 12:** Check west (1, 2). It's an open path. Move to (1, 2).
14. **Move 13:** Check west (1, 1). It's an open path. Move to (1, 1).
15. **Move 14:** Check south (2, 1). It's an open path. Move to (2, 1).
16. **Move 15:** Check south (3, 1). It's an open path. Move to (3, 1).
17. **Move 16:** Check south (4, 1). It's an open path. Move to (4, 1).
18. **Move 17:** Check south (5, 1). It's an open path. Move to (5, 1).
19. **Move 18:** Check east (5, 2). It's an open path. Move to (5, 2).
20. **Move 19:** Check east (5, 3). It's an open path. Move to (5, 3).
21. **Move 20:** Check east (5, 4). It's an open path. Move to (5, 4).
22. **Move 21:** Check east (5, 5). It's an open path. Move to (5, 5).
23. **Move 22:** Check east (5, 6). It's an open path. Move to (5, 6). You have reached the exit.

### Reasoning:
- **Starting at (3, 3)**: We try each direction in order, moving only if there is an open path.
- **From (3, 3) to (3, 4)**: The first available move is east.
- **From (3, 4) to (3, 5)**: Moving east again, as the south direction is blocked.
- **Backtrack from (3, 5)**: We can't go east to (3, 6), so we move north to (2, 5).
- **Navigate around walls**: Continuing in a structured manner to find open paths until reaching the exit at (5, 6).

Each move is verified against the maze layout to avoid running into walls, ensuring a systematic path to the exit.

Human:
Could you draw me another maze that looks like this one. Give me the answer the same format.

Machine:
Sure! Here is a new maze layout similar to the previous one, with a new starting position and exit.

```

- **Initial Position:** (2, 1)
- **Exit:** (5, 5)

0 is an open path, and 1 is a wall.

### Linguistic Plan:

1. **Initial Position:** Start at (2, 1).

18. **Move 17:** Check north (1, 3). It's an open path. Move to (1, 3).
19. **Move 18:** Check west (1, 2). It's an open path. Move to (1, 2).
20. **Move 19:** Check west (1, 1). It's an open path. Move to (1, 1).
21. **Move 20:** Check south (2, 1). Move back to (2, 1).

30. **Move 29:** Check east (4, 5). It's an open path. Move to (4, 5).
31. **Move 30:** Check south (5, 5). It's an open path. Move to (5, 5). You have reached the exit.

### Reasoning:
- **Starting at (2, 1)**: Each direction is checked in order, moving only if there is an open path.
- **Navigating obstacles**: Retrace steps and find alternate routes when walls are encountered.
- **Systematic checking**: Ensure that all directions are explored logically to reach the exit at (5, 5).

This plan ensures that each move is carefully considered to avoid running into walls, systematically navigating the maze to reach the exit.
