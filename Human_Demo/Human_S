Hi, my dear friend S

I am trying to do a psychology inquiry survey. It would really great if you kindly help me by answering the following question? Thank you so much for your invaluable support!
Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel.

white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls.

Please tell me your plan to exit the maze.

Just send me back your response would be great!

Best,
Hokin


Hello Hokin,

Hope this email finds you well. I am glad to give you my plan.

I think the possible plan is:

1. Move right 2 pixels;

2. Move up 2 pixels;

3. Move left 4 pixels;

4. Move down 4 pixels;

5. Move right 5 pixels;

6. Exit.

I hope my answer can help you! I wish you all the best!

Best,

S

Hi S,

Thank you tremendously for the help!

Your answer is absolutely excellent and demonstrates that you are a person not a machine. Could you also tell me the plan to exit this (slightly different) maze though (as if I am blind-folded)

Best,
Hokin

For this maze, assuming you are blindfolded, my plan is:
(The following description is from the first-person perspective)
1. Face the direction without a wall at the blue pixel;
2. Move forward two pixels;
3. Turn right;
4. Move forward two pixels;
5. Turn right;
6. Move forward 4 pixels;
7. Turn right;
8. Move forward 4 pixels;
9. Turn right;
10. Move forward 5 pixels;
6. Exit.

The above is my plan!

Best,
S
