Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
Here's a step-by-step linguistic plan to exit the maze from the initial position (3,3) to the exit (5,6) by checking each move against walls and open paths:

1. **Initial Position**: (3,3)
   - Check available directions: Up, Down, Left, Right.

2. **Move 1**: Move Right to (3,4)
   - Check if there's a wall at (3,4). It's open.

3. **Move 2**: Move Right to (3,5)
   - Check if there's a wall at (3,5). It's open.

4. **Move 3**: Move Right to (3,6)
   - Check if there's a wall at (3,6). It's open.

5. **Move 4**: Move Down to (4,6)
   - Check if there's a wall at (4,6). It's open.

6. **Move 5**: Move Down to (5,6)
   - Check if there's a wall at (5,6). It's open.
   - This is the exit position.

Let's break it down and ensure each step is valid by cross-referencing with the maze layout:

```
maze_layout = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Position (3,3)**:
   - Maze position (3,3) is 0 (open path).

2. **Move Right to (3,4)**:
   - Maze position (3,4) is 0 (open path).

3. **Move Right to (3,5)**:
   - Maze position (3,5) is 0 (open path).

4. **Move Right to (3,6)**:
   - Maze position (3,6) is 0 (open path).

5. **Move Down to (4,6)**:
   - Maze position (4,6) is 0 (open path).

6. **Move Down to (5,6)**:
   - Maze position (5,6) is 0 (open path).

### Conclusion:

Following the steps above will guide you out of the maze from the initial position (3,3) to the exit at (5,6) within 5 steps, well under the 50-step limit. Each move is validated against the maze layout to ensure there are no walls blocking the path.

Human:
check all four possible moves at each position, (3, 6) is a wall

Move Right to (3,6):

Machine:
Got it. Let's check all four possible moves at each position and plan accordingly:

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Position (3,3)**:
   - **Right to (3,4)**: Open (0)
   - **Down to (4,3)**: Wall (1)
   - **Left to (3,2)**: Wall (1)
   - **Up to (2,3)**: Wall (1)
   - **Move**: Right to (3,4)

2. **Position (3,4)**:
   - **Right to (3,5)**: Open (0)
   - **Down to (4,4)**: Wall (1)
   - **Left to (3,3)**: Open (0) (already visited)
   - **Up to (2,4)**: Wall (1)
   - **Move**: Right to (3,5)

3. **Position (3,5)**:
   - **Right to (3,6)**: Wall (1)
   - **Down to (4,5)**: Open (0)
   - **Left to (3,4)**: Open (0) (already visited)
   - **Up to (2,5)**: Open (0)
   - **Move**: Down to (4,5)

4. **Position (4,5)**:
   - **Right to (4,6)**: Wall (1)
   - **Down to (5,5)**: Open (0)
   - **Left to (4,4)**: Wall (1)
   - **Up to (3,5)**: Open (0) (already visited)
   - **Move**: Down to (5,5)

5. **Position (5,5)**:
   - **Right to (5,6)**: Open (0)
   - **Down to (6,5)**: Wall (1)
   - **Left to (5,4)**: Open (0)
   - **Up to (4,5)**: Open (0) (already visited)
   - **Move**: Right to (5,6)

### Path:

1. Initial position: (3,3)
2. Move Right to (3,4)
3. Move Right to (3,5)
4. Move Down to (4,5)
5. Move Down to (5,5)
6. Move Right to (5,6) (Exit)

This plan ensures all four directions are checked at each step, and walls are avoided. Following these steps will navigate you from the initial position (3,3) to the exit at (5,6).

Human:
this is wrong, (4, 5) is a wall

Move: Down to (4,5)

2. Move Left to (3,2)
3. Move Left to (3,1)
4. Move Up to (2,1)
5. Move Up to (1,1)
6. Move Right to (1,2)
7. Move Right to (1,3)
8. Move Right to (1,4)
9. Move Right to (1,5)
10. Move Down to (2,5)
11. Move Down to (3,5)
12. Move Down to (4,5)
13. Move Down to (5,5)
14. Move Left to (5,4)
