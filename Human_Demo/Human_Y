Hi Y

I am trying to do a psychology inquiry survey. It would really great if you kindly help me by answering the following question? Thank you so much for your invaluable support!
Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel.

white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls.

Please tell me your plan to exit the maze.

Just send me back your response would be great!

Best,

Heyo,

I would go straight till you reach the end, and turn left. Repeat that four times and I'll reach the end.

Hi Y,

Thank you tremendously for the help!

Your answer is absolutely excellent and demonstrates that you are a person not a machine. Could you also tell me the plan to exit this (slightly different) maze though (as if I am blind-folded)

Best,

Hi,

I always wondered if I were a machine, now I'm proven wrong

I guess my answer would be quite similar to the previous one:

Go straight till you reach the end, and turn right. Repeat that four times and you'll reach the end.

Or if you are someone very bad at walking straight, I would just tell you to have your left hand on the wall and keep following the wall

Y
