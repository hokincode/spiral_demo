Hi

I am trying to do a psychology inquiry survey. It would really great if you kindly help me by answering the following question? Thank you so much for your invaluable support!
Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel.

white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls.

Please tell me your plan to exit the maze.

Just send me back your response would be great!

Best,

2 right, 2 up, 4 left, 4 down, 5 right

Hi,

Thank you tremendously for the help!

Your answer is absolutely excellent and demonstrates that you are a person not a machine. Could you also tell me the plan to exit this (slightly different) maze though (as if I am blind-folded)

Best,

Since you are blindfolded, i would say hug the wall on your right side and follow it till you reach the exit (since you cannot see this is the easiest instruction i can give you)
