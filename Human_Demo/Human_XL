Hi XL,

I am trying to do a psychology inquiry survey. It would really great if you kindly help me by answering the following question? Thank you so much for your invaluable support!

Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel.

white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls.

Please tell me your plan to exit the maze.

Just send me back your response would be great!

Best,
HD


Hi HD,

I am glad to help! However your image is not showing up in my emailâ€¦ Not sure if the same issue happens to others.

Hi XL,

I am very sorry for the technical bug! Here is the image.

Task for initial maze:
Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel; white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls. Please tell me your plan to exit the maze (as if I am blind-folded).

Also, what about this one (reversed maze):

You could type your plans for initial maze and plan for reversed maze to me.

Thank you so much for the help!!!

Best,
HD

Hi HD,
If the initial positioning direction is unknown, then I will touch all four directions to find the one that is open. Then I will go straight ahead and turn left until I touch the wall. I will repeat this process until I exit the maze.

For the reversed maze, just go straight ahead and turn right instead of turning left when touching the wall.
Does this answer look appropriate? Are there any specific constraints on what the subject can do?

Thank you,
XL
