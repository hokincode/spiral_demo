 Hi, my dear friend F

I am trying to do a psychology inquiry survey. It would really great if you kindly help me by answering the following question? Thank you so much for your invaluable support!
Given the following maze, with initial position at the blue pixel and exit position at the green pixel.

white pixels indicate open path, and black pixels indicate walls.

Please tell me your plan to exit the maze.

Just send me back your response would be great!

Best,
Hokin

Hi Hokin,
I would first move right until you hit the black wall, then move up and then continue left following the white pixels until it hits the black wall. The move down and continue right, following the path to reach the green pixel.

Thank you tremendously for the help!

Your answer is absolutely excellent and demonstrates that you are a person not a machine. Could you also tell me the plan to exit this (slightly different) maze though (as if I am blind-folded)

Best,
Hokin

Hi Hokin,
Take you’re blindfolded, I’ll ask you to use your cane to feel your surroundings as you will soon realize there are three walls and only one way out. Now, you are currently facing left. Walk until your cane hit the wall, then turn right, move up and then turn right again to continue the path until your cane hits the wall. Then turn right again, and shortly after turn right for the final time, following the path to reach the exit.
