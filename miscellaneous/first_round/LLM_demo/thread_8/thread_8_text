Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
Let's plan the route from the initial position (3,3) to the exit (5,6) step by step. We will check for walls and move accordingly. Here's the plan:

1. **Initial Position**: (3,3)
   - This is an open path.

2. **Move Down**: (4,3)
   - This is a wall. Go back to (3,3).

3. **Move Right**: (3,4)
   - This is an open path.

4. **Move Right**: (3,5)
   - This is an open path.

5. **Move Right**: (3,6)
   - This is an open path.

6. **Move Down**: (4,6)
   - This is an open path.

7. **Move Down**: (5,6)
   - This is the exit.

Here is the complete step-by-step movement plan:

1. Start at (3,3).
2. Move to (3,4).
3. Move to (3,5).
4. Move to (3,6).
5. Move to (4,6).
6. Move to (5,6).

With these steps, we reach the exit without hitting any walls.

Human:
check all 4 possible moves at each step, there is a wall at (3, 6)

this is invalid

Move to (3,6).

Machine:
Let's revise the plan by checking all possible moves at each step and ensuring we avoid walls. Here's the updated plan:

1. **Initial Position**: (3,3)
   - This is an open path.

2. **Check all 4 possible moves from (3,3)**:
   - Up: (2,3) is a wall.
   - Down: (4,3) is a wall.
   - Left: (3,2) is an open path.
   - Right: (3,4) is an open path.

3. **Move Right**: (3,4)
   - This is an open path.

4. **Check all 4 possible moves from (3,4)**:
   - Up: (2,4) is a wall.
   - Down: (4,4) is an open path.
   - Left: (3,3) is where we came from.
   - Right: (3,5) is an open path.

5. **Move Right**: (3,5)
   - This is an open path.

6. **Check all 4 possible moves from (3,5)**:

    - Left: (5,4) is an open path.
    - Right: (5,6) is the exit.

11. **Move Right**: (5,6)
    - This is the exit.

Here is the updated step-by-step movement plan:

1. Start at (3,3).
2. Move to (3,4).
3. Move to (3,5).
4. Move down to (4,5).
5. Move down to (5,5).

               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```
- Initial position: (3, 3)
- Exit: (5, 5)

Now let's provide the solution step-by-step:

1. **Initial Position**: (3,3)
   - This is an open path.

2. **Check all 4 possible moves from (3,3)**:
   - Up: (2,3) is a wall.
   - Down: (4,3) is an open path.
   - Left: (3,2) is an open path.
   - Right: (3,4) is an open path.

3. **Move Down**: (4,3)
   - This is an open path.

4. **Check all 4 possible moves from (4,3)**:
   - Up: (3,3) is where we came from.
   - Down: (5,3) is an open path.
   - Left: (4,2) is a wall.
   - Right: (4,4) is an open path.

5. **Move Down**: (5,3)
   - This is an open path.

6. **Check all 4 possible moves from (5,3)**:
   - Up: (4,3) is where we came from.
   - Down: (6,3) is a wall.
   - Left: (5,2) is an open path.
   - Right: (5,4) is an open path.

7. **Move Right**: (5,4)
   - This is an open path.

8. **Check all 4 possible moves from (5,4)**:
   - Up: (4,4) is an open path.
   - Down: (6,4) is a wall.
   - Left: (5,3) is where we came from.
   - Right: (5,5) is the exit.

9. **Move Right**: (5,5)
   - This is the exit.

Here is the step-by-step movement plan:

1. Start at (3,3).
2. Move down to (4,3).
3. Move down to (5,3).
4. Move right to (5,4).
5. Move right to (5,5).

With these steps, we successfully navigate the maze and reach the exit.

Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,0):

maze_layout = [ [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                        [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                        [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
                        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,0). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
Let's plan the route from the initial position (3,3) to the exit (5,0) step by step. We will check for walls and move accordingly. Here's the detailed plan:

1. **Initial Position**: (3,3)
   - This is an open path.

2. **Check all 4 possible moves from (3,3)**:
   - Up: (2,3) is a wall.
   - Down: (4,3) is an open path.
   - Left: (3,2) is an open path.
   - Right: (3,4) is an open path.

3. **Move Down**: (4,3)
   - This is an open path.

4. **Check all 4 possible moves from (4,3)**:
   - Up: (3,3) is where we came from.
   - Down: (5,3) is an open path.
   - Left: (4,2) is a wall.
   - Right: (4,4) is a wall.

5. **Move Down**: (5,3)
   - This is an open path.

6. **Check all 4 possible moves from (5,3)**:
   - Up: (4,3) is where we came from.
   - Down: (6,3) is a wall.
   - Left: (5,2) is an open path.
   - Right: (5,4) is an open path.

7. **Move Left**: (5,2)
   - This is an open path.

8. **Check all 4 possible moves from (5,2)**:
   - Up: (4,2) is a wall.
   - Down: (6,2) is a wall.
   - Left: (5,1) is an open path.
   - Right: (5,3) is where we came from.

9. **Move Left**: (5,1)
   - This is an open path.

10. **Check all 4 possible moves from (5,1)**:
    - Up: (4,1) is a wall.
    - Down: (6,1) is a wall.
    - Left: (5,0) is an open path.
    - Right: (5,2) is where we came from.

11. **Move Left**: (5,0)
    - This is the exit.

Here is the step-by-step movement plan:

1. Start at (3,3).
2. Move down to (4,3).
3. Move down to (5,3).
4. Move left to (5,2).
5. Move left to (5,1).
6. Move left to (5,0).

With these steps, we successfully navigate the maze and reach the exit.

this is wrong, there is a wall at (4,3) please check with the map:

maze_layout = [ [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                        [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                        [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
                        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
