Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
Let's revise the plan by verifying all four possible moves (up, down, left, right) at each step:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Start at (3,3).**
2. **Check possible moves from (3,3):**
   - **Up to (2,3):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Down to (4,3):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Left to (3,2):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Right to (3,4):** It's an open path (0). Move to (3,4).

3. **Check possible moves from (3,4):**
   - **Up to (2,4):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Down to (4,4):** It's an open path (0). Move to (4,4).
   - **Left to (3,3):** Already visited.
   - **Right to (3,5):** It's an open path (0). Move to (3,5).

4. **Check possible moves from (3,5):**
   - **Up to (2,5):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Down to (4,5):** It's an open path (0). Move to (4,5).
   - **Left to (3,4):** Already visited.
   - **Right to (3,6):** It's a wall (1).

5. **Check possible moves from (4,5):**
   - **Up to (3,5):** Already visited.
   - **Down to (5,5):** It's an open path (0). Move to (5,5).
   - **Left to (4,4):** Already visited.
   - **Right to (4,6):** It's a wall (1).

6. **Check possible moves from (5,5):**
   - **Up to (4,5):** Already visited.
   - **Down to (6,5):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Left to (5,4):** It's an open path (0). Move to (5,4).
   - **Right to (5,6):** It's an open path (0). Move to (5,6).

7. **Reached Exit at (5,6).**

### Summary of Moves

1. Start at (3,3).
2. Move Right to (3,4).
3. Move Right to (3,5).
4. Move Down to (4,5).
5. Move Down to (5,5).
6. Move Right to (5,6).

### Reasoning

- Verify all four possible moves at each step.
- Check for open paths and walls.
- Avoid revisiting previously visited positions.
- Continue moving towards the exit by choosing open paths.

By following these steps, you can navigate the maze correctly by checking all possible moves and ensuring each move is valid.

Human:
This is wrong;

Move Down to (4,5).

Machine:
Let's correct the plan step by step, verifying all possible moves at each step.

By following these steps and checking all possible moves, you can navigate the maze correctly to reach the exit at (5,6).

Human:
Could you draw me another maze that looks like this one. Give me the answer the same format.

### New Maze Layout

Let's create a new maze with a similar spiral structure:

```
new_maze_layout = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                   [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                   [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
                   [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

### Starting Position and Exit

- **Initial position:** (3, 3)
- **Exit:** (5, 5)

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Start at (3,3).**
2. **Check possible moves from (3,3):**
   - **Up to (2,3):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Down to (4,3):** It's an open path (0). Move to (4,3).
   - **Left to (3,2):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Right to (3,4):** It's an open path (0). Move to (3,4).

3. **Check possible moves from (3,4):**
   - **Up to (2,4):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Down to (4,4):** It's an open path (0). Move to (4,4).
   - **Left to (3,3):** Already visited.
   - **Right to (3,5):** It's a wall (1).

4. **Check possible moves from (4,4):**
   - **Up to (3,4):** Already visited.
   - **Down to (5,4):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Left to (4,3):** Already visited.
   - **Right to (4,5):** It's an open path (0). Move to (4,5).

5. **Check possible moves from (4,5):**
   - **Up to (3,5):** It's a wall (1).
   - **Down to (5,5):** It's an open path (0). Move to (5,5).
   - **Left to (4,4):** Already visited.
   - **Right to (4,6):** It's a wall (1).

6. **Reached Exit at (5,5).**

### Summary of Moves

1. Start at (3,3).
2. Move Down to (4,3).
3. Move Right to (3,4).
4. Move Down to (4,4).
5. Move Right to (4,5).
6. Move Down to (5,5).

### Reasoning

- **Initial position (3,3):** Start from the given initial position.
- **Move Down to (4,3):** Check if it's an open path.
- **Move Right to (3,4):** Check if it's an open path.
- **Move Down to (4,4):** Check if it's an open path.
- **Move Right to (4,5):** Check if it's an open path.
- **Move Down to (5,5):** Check if it's an open path. This is the exit position.

By following these steps and checking all possible moves, you can navigate the maze correctly to reach the exit at (5,5).
