Human:
Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.

Machine:
Alright, let's navigate this maze step-by-step while checking each move against the walls and open paths. Here's the maze for reference:

```plaintext
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

- **Start Position:** (3,3)
- **Exit Position:** (5,6)

### Linguistic Plan:

1. **Step 1:** Move right to (3,4). Check if there's a wall.
   - No wall. Move to (3,4).
2. **Step 2:** Move right to (3,5). Check if there's a wall.
   - No wall. Move to (3,5).
3. **Step 3:** Move right to (3,6). Check if there's a wall.
   - Wall detected. Return to (3,5).
4. **Step 4:** Move down to (4,5). Check if there's a wall.
   - Wall detected. Return to (3,5).
5. **Step 5:** Move left to (3,4). Check if there's a wall.
   - No wall. Move to (3,4).
6. **Step 6:** Move left to (3,3). Check if there's a wall.
   - No wall. Move to (3,3).
7. **Step 7:** Move left to (3,2). Check if there's a wall.
   - Wall detected. Return to (3,3).
8. **Step 8:** Move up to (2,3). Check if there's a wall.
   - Wall detected. Return to (3,3).
9. **Step 9:** Move down to (4,3). Check if there's a wall.
   - Wall detected. Return to (3,3).
10. **Step 10:** Move down to (5,3). Check if there's a wall.
    - No wall. Move to (5,3).
11. **Step 11:** Move right to (5,4). Check if there's a wall.
    - No wall. Move to (5,4).
12. **Step 12:** Move right to (5,5). Check if there's a wall.
    - No wall. Move to (5,5).
13. **Step 13:** Move right to (5,6). Check if there's a wall.
    - No wall. Move to (5,6).

### Path to Exit:

- Start at (3,3)
- Move to (3,4)
- Move to (3,5)
- Return to (3,4)
- Return to (3,3)
- Move to (5,3)
- Move to (5,4)
- Move to (5,5)
- Exit at (5,6)

### Summary:

- Move: right, right (encounter wall), left, left, left (encounter wall), up (encounter wall), down (encounter wall), down, right, right, right
- Total steps: 13 steps to reach the exit.

This plan ensures that each move is checked against the maze layout, ensuring no walls block the path.

Human:
This is impossible:

Step 9: Move down to (4,3). Check if there's a wall.
Wall detected. Return to (3,3).
Step 10: Move down to (5,3). Check if there's a wall.
No wall. Move to (5,3).

Check all possible four moves at each step

Machine:
